# Agentic
Agentic is a web application and platform for exploring how AI tools can help developers write better software. 

Using Github Copilot in agentic mode is hard. AI often hallucinates, has no strict rules, and writes code as a junior that sees the code base for the very first time.
The purpose of this web app is to provide an easy way for you to get a guided AI Agent, that follows well though through rules, and writes maintainable, understandable and performant code.

This is a public repository, and will also be a playground for AI exploration. Knowledge and decisions will be explained on my blog, [engineeringWithFilip.com](https://engineeringwithfilip.com).
